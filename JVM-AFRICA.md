JVM AFRICA is a non profit organization that is focused on improving software skills targeted for languages that run on the JVM. We do this through hosting free workshops and hackathons throughout Africa.

We seek to create a community of software developers that are reflective of the diversity in the general population. To that end, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other such characteristics.

Everyone has something to contribute. Everyone deserves access to materials and community that will help them learn. As long as an individual can be respectful and not disruptive to other participants, they deserve to participate.

We are always looking for people to come and speak at our events. So if you have an idea for a talk, a discussion or just want to show folks what you have been working on, please get in touch. You don't need to be a professional speaker or even to have spoken in a group before.If you don't want to do a talk, but are interested in hearing about a specific subject, or have an idea/problem, please get in touch and we will try and find someone who can help.

Thanks for Attending!

Hi Nairobi JVM !

Thank you for attending our July meetup and making it a great event! It was a pleasure to meet you all and we hope you enjoyed the talk by Kabir Idris.

Our next event  and will feature a talk by Mark Brian Otieno. He is an Oracle cloud consultant. He will share his experience in Performance Tuning and Profiling Java applications in the wild. Working as a cloud consultant at Oracle Kenya, Mark has been involved in a fair share of fixing production issues for clients.  You do not want to miss this one. 

If you enjoyed the talks, we’d love if you could share Nairobi JVM’s next event link with your friends and colleagues. As always, if you would like to provide us with any feedback feel free to drop us an email.

We also talked about hosting a Scala Workshop and a few of you have expressed interest. We have created a form that you can input your details so we have an idea of how many of you would be joining us.

Thank you to our sponsor for July: [AfricasTalking](https://africastalking.com/). 

See you all on the 4th **of August** for more great talks. 

Enjoy the rest of your week and have a great weekend!

Hungai & Daniel

Thank you for offering me the CTO position at ATLabs. I would like to express again how excited I am to begin working for AT.

Before I can accept however, I would like to discuss the matter of compensation. Like I mentioned yesterday I am ready to commit up to 40 hrs a week to make sure that Sure Technologies is able to go to market in the 6 months that this contract is for.  Not only will I be bringing stewardship expertise to a young startup but also immense experience from building customer facing products at Lightbend  and building data pipelines for a wide variety of companies under a company called Maven Code ([https://mavencode.com/](https://mavencode.com/) - Contact details available on request) Since the position is of an Independent Contractor without any benefits I am inclined to share what my rate has been for similar engagements. 30 dollars an hour and I can work up to 40 hrs a week. In my experience 20 hrs a week is possible but there is a lot of context switching resulting in the project taking longer to complete. 

I can certainly see a future for myself at ATLabs, and I’m confident that I can bring a lot of value. I know that we can come to a mutual agreement on an acceptable salary.

Thank you for your time,

Good afternoon, If you are in Nairobi and interested in learning Scala Programming? We will be doing a Scala Workshop on the 18th of August. Kindly sign up here [http://bit.ly/scalaworkshop](http://bit.ly/scalaworkshop)
