# Notes


My learning process usually involves multiple passes over material that covers the subject I’m trying to learn. The first pass is just to get the higher level ideas and introduce the vocabulary. I refer to this as the point where I build an index in my head of concepts. So I read through the book fairly quickly without worrying about if I deeply understood each part since I’m intending on either re-reading it, or picking up another book to cover the same material in a slightly different way.
